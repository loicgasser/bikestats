    \section{Problems in the Bicincitta data set from
2013}\label{problems-in-the-bicincitta-data-set-from-2013}

There are problems with the Bicincitta data that we need to address
before loading the data into a reliable and proper data-base. We will
point out these problems using examples, and measure their magnitude
using systematic analysis, and then speculate about the cause behind
these problems.

    \subsection{Data}\label{data}

We load the data from JSONs provided to us by Bicincitta at the end of
April 2015.


    The resulting data is in the form of lists of dictionaries.


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
a subnetwork is described by, 
	id
	name

 a station is described by,
	latitude
	name
	id
	longitude
	subnetwork\_id

 a user is described by 
	subnetwork\_id
	gender
	expires
	postal\_code
	address
	id

 a transaction is described by, 
	direction
	user\_id
	event\_time
	created\_at
	updated\_at
	station\_id
	id
    \end{Verbatim}

    The resulting dictionaries have ids that are UTF-8 strings. We change
these to integers to make our work easier. The addersses in the user
data are web-quotes, which we need to \emph{unquote}. We will also
unquote the station names, just to be safe. There are keys in a
transaction that do not seem to correspond to the data, but refer to the
time at which the data was loaded into the JSON provided to us.We will
drop these variables, and change the \emph{event\_time} to a time
object.



    



    \subsection{Who are the users?}\label{who-are-the-users}

The simplest question may be the fraction of females vs males,


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Of all the users  60  percent are female  and  39  percent males.
    \end{Verbatim}

    It would be interesting if 60\% of the users were in fact female.
However, as we will see later there seems to be a problem of user
duplicacy biased towards females. This bias towards is much worse among
the users for whome an address is available. More than ninety percent of
the users with an available address in the data are female.

    \subsection{Subnetworks for stations users, and
transactions}\label{subnetworks-for-stations-users-and-transactions}

We have a data table for subnetworks, which contains the subnetwork's id
and name. Both users and stations have been assigned a
\emph{subnetwork\_id} which should be an integer pointing to the
\emph{id} variable in the subnetwork table. We would expect all the
subnetworks in this table to be conceptually equivalent. Thus the
subnetworks \emph{PubliBike} and \emph{Campus} should refer to the same
concept of a subnetwork. However a peek at the data hints against this
assumption. \textbf{It seems that there are two distinct concepts of a
subnetwork in the subnetwork table.} There are several lines of evidence
leading us to this conclusion.

First of all, only 11 of the 18 subnetworks have a station assigned to
them, and 7 have no stations (see table in the appendix).



    While none of the stations have been assigned the subnetwork, most of
the users are in subnetwork PubliBike,


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Number of users from subnetwork PubliBike is 58927
    \end{Verbatim}

    The subnetworks thus appear to mean two different things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  a geographic subnetwork that has stations
\item
  an administrative subnetwork that is assigned to a user when she signs
  up.
\end{enumerate}







    So we assign each transaction an administrative and a geographic
subnetwork. The administrative subnetwork is the subnetwork that the
user of the transaction has been assigned, and the geographic subnetwork
is the subnetwork that the station of the transaction has been assigned.
So administratively, all the transactions are in PubliBike, while
geographically they are in 11 different subnetworks. In the appendix we
present a table for subnetworks, showing the number of transactions that
fall in a subnetwork, both administratively and geographically, along
with the number of users.

Looking at the actual number of users who have registered a transaction
makes us question the validity of the user data base.


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Fraction of users who have registered a transaction 0.10673152586
    \end{Verbatim}

    With only 10\% users with registered transactions, where are the
remaining 90\% users from ? Are they left-overs from previous versions
of the system? Or is there an error in the database? Additionally, all
the users with the transactions have been assigned the subnetwork
\emph{PubliBike}.

    \subsection{User addresses}\label{user-addresses}

There are several problems associated with user addresses. We have
already noticed, and fixed, that the provided addresses in the JSON have
not been \emph{unquoted} from their web encoding. Here we continue to
explore other problems that may arise in the addresses.

We want to count the number of users at one address. Because the
addresses have been provided as strings, we have to be able to aggregate
all address strings that describe the same address. We have written a
python function to do this task, which takes the address and postal-code
strings to provide a combined string taking into account some empirical
disambiguation criteria such as \emph{Av, Ave}, for \emph{Avenue}.

Addresses are not available for all the users.


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Number of users with available address 21659  of which only  15446  unique
    \end{Verbatim}


    What fraction of unique addresses have multiple users?


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
0.230545124951
    \end{Verbatim}

    How many users at addresses with multiple users?


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
9774
    \end{Verbatim}

    which corresponds to a fraction of all users with available address,


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
0.451267371531
    \end{Verbatim}

    Multiple users at the same address could be actual multiple people, or
multiple registrations by the same person, or a database error. We can
consider as an example the address with the most multiplicity of 53,


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
address:  via lambertenghi 1; 6900 , number of users:  53
    \end{Verbatim}

    We could say more about the multiple users at the same address if we
look at their transactions. However as it turns out, we \textbf{do not
have addresses for users who have registered transactions in the data}.
