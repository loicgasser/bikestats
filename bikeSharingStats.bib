abstract = "Abstract Bicycle sharing systems (bike-shares) are becoming increasingly popular in towns and cities around the world. They are viewed as a cheap, efficient, and healthy means of navigating dense urban environments. This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing characteristics by analysing data from 38 systems located in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this, an extensive database depicting the geographical location and bicycle occupancy of each docking station within a particular system has been created over a number of years to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and others) and provide a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them. Analysis of the variation of occupancy rates over time, and comparison across the system’s extent, infers the likely demographics and intentions of user groups. A classification of bike-shares, based on the geographical footprint and diurnal, day-of-week and spatial variations in occupancy rates, is proposed. The knowledge of such patterns and characteristics identifiable from the dataset has a range of applications, including informing operators and policymakers about the maintenance of a suitable balance of bicycles throughout the system area (a nontrivial problem for many bike-shares), the location of new docking stations and cycle lanes, and better targeting of promotional materials to encourage new users. Within the context of transport research, the systems utilised here are part of relatively small, closed environments that can be more easily modelled and validated. Such work lays foundations for the analysis of larger scale transport systems by creating a classification of the different systems and seeks to demonstrate that bike-shares have a lot to offer both as an effective method of transport and a rich source of data.

abstract = "Bike sharing systems have recently enabled sustainable means of shared mobility through automated rental stations. Spatio-temporal variation of bike rentals, however, leads to imbalances in the distribution of bikes causing full or empty stations.
The resource allocation problem tackles imbalances at a tactical planning level by means of bike allocation and relocation. We propose a MIP formulation of an extended dynamic service network design model. The objective is to determine optimal fill levels at stations while minimizing the expected costs of relocation for the typical bike demand. The MIP formulation is hard to solve due to a large number of binary variables for relocations (stations times stations times periods). Thus, we present a hybrid metaheuristic integrating a large neighborhood search with exact solution methods provided by a solver. The large neighborhood search iteratively improves the solution with the help of limiting and controlling possible relocation regimes by a fix-and-optimize strategy, i.e. a small subset of “free” binary relocation variables. The majority of remaining binary variables are tentatively fixed to zero leading to a fast solvable truncated MIP of the resource allocation problem. Therefore, a commercial solver can provide a local optimal value based on the defined neighborhood, in a reasonable time. Results obtained indicate that the hybrid metaheuristic outperforms CPLEX for data from Vienna’s bike sharing system Citybike Wien."

Such an approach may provide latent factors that reveal how regions o different usage interact over time. More generally, the propsed methodolgoy can be ued to clsuter edges of temporal valued-graphs with respect to their temporal profiles and is thus particularly suited to mine patterns in dynamic Origin/Destination matrices commonly encountered in the field of transport.

	abstract={We focus on predicting demands of bicycle usage in Velib system of Paris, which is a large-scale bicyle sharing service covering the whole Paris and its near suburbs. In this sytem, bicyle demand of each station usually correlates with historical Velib usage records at both spatial and temporal scale. The spatio-temporal correlation acts as an important factor affecting bicycle demands in the system. Thus it is a necessary information source for predicting bicycle demand of each station accurately. To investigate the spatio-temporal correlation pattern and integrate it into prediction, we propose a spatio-temporal network filtering process to achieve the prediction goal. The linkage structure of the network encodes the underlying correlation information. We utilize a sparsity regularized negative  binomial regression based variable selection method to learn the network structure automatically from the Velib usage data, which is designed to highlight important spatio-temporal correlation between historical bicycle usage records and the bicycle demands of each station. Once we identify the network structure, a prediction model fit well with our goal is obtained directly. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we test it on a large-scale record set of Velib usage. }

Most of BSSs also provide an open access to their data, through APIs, and in particular an access to real time status reports on their bike stations. The analysis of the data generated by such systems is of particular interest for BSS providers, researchers in social science and even users. This work was motivated by the analysis and the comparison of several European BSSs. To this end, a model-based clustering method, called FunFEM, for time series (or more generally functional data) is developed. It is based on a discriminative functional mixture model which allows the clustering of the data in a functional subspace. This model presents the advantage to be parsimonious and can therefore handle long time series. Numerical experiments confirm the good behavior of FunFEM, in particular compared to state-of-the-art methods. The application of FunFEM to BSS data from JCDecaux and Transport for Longdon Initiative provides insightful analyses on the Velib system and informative comparisons between 8 European BSSs/}

One urban mobility measures adopted by major cities as an additional mean of sustainable intermodal transport is the implementation of Bike Sharing Systems.

In this paper we investigate the analysis of BSS systems through the clustering of their stations and the origin-destination flow-data with respect to their trips data. This approach offers the possibility to highlight mobility patterns in the BSS usage. The analysis of the results shows that the clustering found is closely related to the city functions (transportation, leisure, employment) which can be helpful for a variety of applications, including urban planning and the choice of business location. Crossing the results of the model with sociological and economic data is carried out to show the close links between these two aspects and the use of a bike sharing transport scheme, which m ay be useful for bike redistribution planning and for designing new BSSs.},

	abstract={Bike-sharing systems allow people to rent a bicycle at one of many automatic rental stations scattered around the city, use them for a short journey and return them at any station in the city. A crucial factor for the success of a bike-sharing system is its ability to meet the fluctuating demand for bicycles and for vacant lockers at each station. This is achieved by means of a repositioning operation, which consists of removing bicycles from stations and transferring them to other stations, using a dedicated fleet of trucks. Operating such a fleet in a large bike-sharing system is an intricate problem consisting of decisions regarding the routes that the vehicles should follow and the number of bicylces that should be removed or placed at each station on each visit of the vehicles. In this paper, we present our modeling approach to the problem that generalizes existing routing models in the literature. This is done by introducing a unique convex objevtive function as well as time-related considerations. We present two mixed integer linear program formulations, discuss the assumptions associated with each, strenghten them by several valid inqualities and dominance rules, and compare their performances through an extensive numerical study. The results indicate that one of the forumulations is very effective in obtaining high quality solutions to real life instances of the problem consisting of up to 104 stations and two vehicles. Finally, we draw insights on the characteristics of good solutions.}

	abstract={This paper presents an integrated approach of intelligent data analysis and mathematical optimization
to support tactical resource allocation in bike sharing systems. Bike sharing has recently
enabled sustainable means of shared mobility by automated rental stations in metropolitan
areas. Spatio-temporal variation of bike rentals leads to imbalances in the distribution of
bikes causing full or empty stations in the course of a day. Ensuring the reliable provision of
bikes and bike racks is crucial for the viability of these systems. This can be done within the
scope of tactical resource allocation. Tactical planning requires the anticipation of operational
decisions and a suitable aggregation of input data.
We present a linear programming formulation aiming at cost-efficient allocation of bikes to
stations given a predefined service level for different scenarios of bike demand. In particular,
tactical decisions regard the fulfilment of time-dependent target fill levels of bikes at stations.
Target fill levels serve as input for the detailed planning of relocation tours on the operational
level. Different scenarios of bike demand are considered as realizations of typical bike flows
between stations in terms of time-dependent origin / destination matrices. We employ an intelligent
data analysis approach to generate aggregated input data from individual trips recorded
in Bike Sharing Systems. Intelligent data analysis produces spatio-temporal distributions of
bike flows and helps determining typical trip purposes in combination with methods from the
field of traffic modeling.
The proposed methodology is exemplified based on two years of trip data from Vienna’s
Citybike Wien. Computational experiments show changing appropriate target fill levels for
a potential increase of demand. Furthermore, determined characteristics of relocation regimes
can support BSS operators in the planning and implementation of relocation.},

A major operational cost driveer in these systems is rebalancing the bikes over time such that the appropriate number of bikes and open docks are available to users. We combine two aspects that have previously been handled separately in the literature: determining service level requirements at each bike sharing station, and desiging (near-) optimal vehicle routes to rebalance the inventory. Since finding provably optimal solutions is practically intractable, we propose a new cluster-first route-second heuristic, in which the polynomial size Clustering Problem simultaneously considers the service level feasibility constraints and approximate routing costs. Extensive computational results on real-world data from Hubway (Boston, MA) and Capital Bikeshare (Washington, DC) are provided, which show that our heuristic outperforms a pure mixed integer programming formulation and a constraint programming approach.},
